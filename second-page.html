    <h1>Racial-ethnic Differences in Support of the the BLM movement</h1>

    <div>
    <ul class="a">
    <li>
      Research on attitudes toward the Black Lives Matter movement is emerging. There are few published studies yet, especially comparing support across racial ethnic groups, or for nonwhite groups specifically. However:
    </li>
    <li>
      Across racial-thnic groups, White individuals are less likely to support the BLM movement than those of other racial-ethnic groups (Arora & Stout, 2019; Corral, 2020; Holt & Sweitzer, 2020; IIchi & Frank, 2020; Yellow Horse, Kuo, Seaton, & Vargas, 2021)
    </li>
  </ul>

    <h1>Asian Americans and the BLM movement</h1>
    <div>
      <ul class="a">
      <li>
      Asian American support for Black Lives Matter is divided. For instance, Liu (2018) in an ethnographic study of social protest in NYC shows that some Asians reject BLM due to their own concerns about identity, belonging and mobility in the U.S. as well as to holding anti-Black racial attitudes.
    </li>
    <li>
      Yellow Horse, et al. (2021) focus on Asian indifference to BLM and find that those who report experiences with discrimination and also acknowledge discrimination faced by Black Americans are less likely to be indifferent to BLM.  Also find that women and older Asians show more indifference to BLM while political conservatives, and those with higher SES show less indifference. They find no relationship between % black residents in the neighborhood and indifference to BLM.
    </li>
